                <h2>Career Objective</h2>
                <p><em>I am a dedicated student specializing in Cloud Computing
                    with a strong proficiency in Java as my primary
                    programming language. Throughout my academic journey, I
                    have honed my skills and gained practical experience
                    through a variety of projects in Java and Python. Additionally,
                     I possess a diverse skill set encompassing web
                    development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and
                    JavaScript, along with expertise in React.js for building
                    dynamic web applications. My passion for cloud
                    technologies has led me to acquire knowledge of cloud
                    platforms like, AWS (Amazon Web Services), Microsoft
                    Azure. I have hands-on experience in deploying and
                    managing applications on these cloud platforms, ensuring
                    scalability, reliability, and efficiency. I also started learning
                    some of the deployment tools like ServiceNow.</em></p>
